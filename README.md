# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Romeo.
This repository hosts various projects that I've done while attending [CSU - Fresno](https://csm.fresnostate.edu/csci/) as an Undergrad (Class of 2023). Overtime, projects of personal interest will appear in the repository. The goal is to create interesting and/or useful software.
